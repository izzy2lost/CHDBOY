# CHDBOY Support Site

Welcome to the CHDBOY project page. This site hosts the public privacy policy, licensing notes, and contact information required for distribution on the Google Play Store.

## Privacy Policy

- **Data collection:** CHDBOY does not collect, transmit, or store personal data. All conversions happen locally on your device.
- **Permissions:** The app uses the Android Storage Access Framework to let you pick source folders without needing broad storage permissions. Notifications are optional but recommended so you can leave the app while CHD conversions finish.
- **Website Policy:** For detailed terms of service and usage policies, please visit our [website policy page](https://izzy2lost.github.io/CHDBOY/policy).

If the policy changes, the updated version will be posted here before a new release is published.
