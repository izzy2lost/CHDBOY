# Terms of Service and Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2025

### Data Collection and Use

CHDBOY is designed with privacy in mind. We are committed to protecting your personal information and ensuring transparency about our practices.

- **No Data Collection:** CHDBOY does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data. All file conversions happen locally on your device.
- **Local Processing:** Your files never leave your device during the conversion process.
- **No Analytics:** We do not use any analytics or tracking tools within the application.
- **No Third-Party Data Sharing:** Since we don't collect data, we don't share any information with third parties.

### Permissions Used

CHDBOY only requests permissions necessary for its functionality:

- **Storage Access Framework:** Used to allow you to select source folders containing files to convert without requiring broad storage permissions.
- **Notifications (Optional):** Recommended but optional. Allows the app to notify you when conversions complete, so you can leave the app running in the background.

### Data Security

- All processing happens locally on your device
- No internet connection is required for the core functionality
- Your files and data remain under your control at all times

### Children's Privacy

CHDBOY does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.
